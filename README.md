# Tildes Extended

## What it is

An attempt at creating a basic browser extension cross-compatible with at least firefox and chrome, that extend [tildes](https://tildes.net) functionalities.

## How to use it

This requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](http://npmjs.com/).  
Change into the example directory and run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

Available npm commands are:

* `npm run lint` to validate the code to be compatible with chrome and firefox
* `npm run serve` to assemble on the fly a non-packaged source code for testing purpose
* `npm run build` to create a distributable source ready to be packaged into an extension
